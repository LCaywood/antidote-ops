    # TODO
    # - add account logic
    # - Add task to wait for a certain time of day before starting (don't forget timeout there too)
    # - Adjust wait_until_pubtime to only publish on weekends
    # - fix timeouts?
    # - Actually need to create a whole new pack for automating content sharing, complete with aliases to immediately share things


# This was originally a Mistral workflow, but since Mistral uses service tokens to authenticate to st2, we need to increase the TTL
# for long-running workflows like this:
        # [auth]
        # service_token_ttl = 604800
        # token_ttl = 604800
# I converted to an actionchain for simplicity - I don't need the differentiating features in Mistral for this, and I don't want to have
# to adjust st2.conf if I can avoid it. Makes this pack more portable.
